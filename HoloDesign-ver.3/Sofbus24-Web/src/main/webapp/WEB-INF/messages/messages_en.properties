<!-- About -->
about.title = About
about.content = The service provides a simple, lightweight mechanism that servers can use to tell mobile applications to contact the server directly, to fetch updated application or user data. The service handles all aspects of queueing of messages and delivery to the target application running on the target device. The free service has the ability to send a lightweight message informing the Android application of new data to be fetched from the server. Larger messages can be sent with up to 4 KB of payload data. Each notification message size is limited to 1024 bytes, and Google limits the number of messages a sender sends in aggregate, and the number of messages a sender sends to a specific device. Applications on an Android device don\u2019t need to be running to receive messages. The system will wake up the application via a mechanism called Intent Broadcast when the message arrives, as long as the application is set up with the proper broadcast receiver and permissions. GCM does not provide any built-in user interface or other handling for message data. Instead, it simply passes raw message data received straight to the application, which has full control of how to handle it. For example, the application might post a notification, display a custom user interface, or silently sync data.
